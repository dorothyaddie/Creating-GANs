Our goal is to create a GAN that is able to draw images of left and right dorsal and palm facing hands. This is the first part of our independent project, Creating GANs. Our goal for this notebook is to create a neural network that will be able to recognize right and left dorsal and palm facing pictures of hands. We used the [11k Hand Dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/11khands)."
